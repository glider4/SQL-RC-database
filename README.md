# SQL-RC-database
 An entire PostgreSQL database built from the ground up for storing RC characteristics and features in an arbitrary
 "Local Store", that allows customer pick-up orders and re-stocking orders from "Vendors".
 
Scope of this project:
 - 11 tables with PK's and relationships
 - DROP TABLE statements (whole build_database.sql is re-runnable)
 - Full Entity-Relationship Diagram
 - Foreign Keys
 - Indexes, although unnecessary until there is more data loaded
 - Specialization-Generalization Relationship
 - < 10 RC models included (more to be added, probably via spreadsheets)
 
 Entity-relationship diagram (still needs minor adjustments):
